### About 
This is my own Front-end JavaScript Developer portfolio website. I designed it with my brother and wrote by myself.<br/><br/>
Compared to my previous projects where I tried to create a clean and minimalist look, the design on this site is a bit more complicated. Our goal was to show my skills more broadly. For this purpose, we have included in the design a three layer parallax, an interactive face and elements sliding in and out of page. Parallax works with both page scrolling and mouse movement.<br/><br/>
Each of the animations was a new thing for me, and therefore challenging. However, overcoming every challenge and knowing that I was able to achieve my goal gave me a lot of satisfaction.br/><br/>
The most difficult to achieve were parallax and icon animation. Parallax in particular was causing me a lot of trouble as it was breaking down due to anchor links and I had trouble getting the scrolling and the mouse parallax to work together. However, the end result was worth the effort :)
